Project Overview
- This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a user's MBTI type. Traditional MBTI tests can easily be manipulated by respondents to affect the outcome. Our project addresses this issue by analyzing differences in opinions and writing styles among MBTI types to predict the user's MBTI type more accurately.

Technology Stack
- Languages and Libraries: Python, KoNLPy, Mecab, word2vec
- UI Development: Simple user interface developed using tkinter
- Features in Development: Backend and frontend development for transition to web service

How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your environment using the MBTI Chatbot Install Guide (currently only available in Korean).
3. Run main.py to start the tkinter-based Python program, or main-api-test.py to run the Flask-based web page.
4. Enter text through the UI and click the analyze button to predict your MBTI type.

Development Status and Plans
- We have currently developed a Python-based prototype and are aiming to transition to a web-based service. This includes additional NLP model tuning and web interface development.

How to Contribute
- If you are interested in contributing to this project, you can do so by creating issues, making pull requests, and more. Ideas or suggestions for improving our MBTI analyzer are also welcome.
